## This is Software EKG - COVID-19 Edition

Software EKG is a powerful tool for time series analysis developed by QAware. Utilizing a highly efficient search index and optimized algorithms, the tool enables you to both visualize and analyze time series containing billions of values.

Our special *COVID-19 Edition* provides you with the latest data on COVID-19 from all countries *worldwide*. Not only can you get a detailed overview of the Coronavirus pandemic in a single country, it is also possible to compare different countries with each other using a plethora of metrics like positive test rate, population density or even hospital beds available.

## Why time series analysis is essential

When analyzing the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic, considering only absolute numbers will not suffice. Instead, it is crucial to take the dimension of time into account. Thus, time series analysis is the key to fully understand current trends and developments regarding COVID-19 and to detect important correlations between metrics (See, for example, the correlation between new death cases (black) and postitive test rate (red) in Germany in the graph below).

We are not offering yet another dashboard. What we are offering is our best and most powerful tool for time series analysis, combined with the latest, comprehensive data on COVID-19.

## What our mission is

Our goal is to provide you with the raw data on COVID-19, included in a tool that lets you analyze, visualize and interpret the impacts of the pandemic on a *long term* basis.
By providing Software EKG - COVID-19 Edition free of charge, QAware wants to contribute to a better understanding of the pandemic and support the global efforts against it.

## Our data source

Software EKG - COVID-19 Edition uses data from [Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/), a scientific online publication based at the University of Oxford with a focus on large-scale global problems.
